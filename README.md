# LeetCode Recorder

> An online tool to keep track of every LeetCode problem you have done.

While enhancing my programming skills through practicing algorithms on LeetCode, I realized the potential benefits of systematically tracking my progress for each problem I solved.
This included recording how long it took me to solve the problem, my approach, and the code I used. Initially, I started documenting these details manually using pen and paper, but soon
found this method too time-consuming. Recognizing the need for a more efficient solution, I decided to digitize the process. The idea was to store this information in a database to ensure it
wouldn't be lost and to make it easily revisitable. Having recently graduated with a master's degree, developing this online platform also provided an excellent opportunity to solidify my
knowledge and learn new skills. This led to the creation of a comprehensive tool that not only helps in preserving my learning progress but also enhances my efficiency in revisiting and learning
from past challenges.
